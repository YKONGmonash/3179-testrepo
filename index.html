    <h1><b>Australian Weather Data</b></h1>
    <h2>Australian Wildfire Brightness Temperature Data</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <div id='text_div'>
            <p>From the visualisation below, you can see the distribution of data points collected by NASA satellites which is publically available.
            <br>The data used here is from the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), an instrument that provides near real-time (NRT) imagery.
            <br> The higher the brightness temperature, the larger the circle and redder it appears on the map of Australia below.
            <br> From the map, we can see that the points are clustered around the edges of the Australian coasts, with only a few points around the centre-west area.

    <h2>Average Temperatures for Australian Cities from 2007-2017 (Â°C)</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <div id='text_div'>
            <p>The visualisation shown below provides a comparison between the average minimum and maximum temperatures for a few selected Australian Cities. 
                <br> From here we can see that the city with the lowest average temperature the past decade is Canberra, while the city with the highest average temperature is Brisbane.
                <br>The data is taken from 2008 to 2017.</p>

    <h2>Melbourne Humidity Data (%)</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <div id='text_div'>
            <p>Using the same time period, we will next look at the average humidity of Melbourne for the past 10 years.
                <br>Taking measurements at two points in the day, 9am and 3pm, we can see that the humidity was at its very lowest during 2015.

    <h2>Melbourne WindGust Data</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <div id='text_div'>
            <p>Finally we will look at the Wind Gust data in Melbourne to see how it correlates with the general humidity of the city, as well as its temperature, to perhaps contribute to the number of wildfires in Australia.</p>
